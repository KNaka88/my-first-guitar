    <h1>First Guitar Buying Guide</h1>

    <p>
    So you want to see about starting guitar lessons, but first you need a guitar. Here's a quick guide to help you out.
    </p>
    <p>
    Here are some things to consider:
      <ul>
        <li>Do you want an <strong><em>electric</em></strong> or <strong><em>acoustic</em></strong> guitar?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
  Either one can be suitable for beginners. Electric guitars require more equipment, but are louder in performances.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you want a full-size, three-quarters or half-sized guitar?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Normally anyone younger than 6 y/o will want a half-sized guitar. A guitar can't be too small, but it can be too big.
      </p>

      <p>Here are some beginner electric guitar recommendations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Squire</li>
          <img src="./Squire_pic.jpg" alt="squire">

        <li>Epiphone</li>
        <li>Stagg</li>
      </ul>
        Acoustic guitars are easy to use because there are no electronics, but more cumbersome to use on stage.
        Also watch out for the width of the body, as that might make it hard to play for young musicians.
        Here are some beginner acoustic guitar recommendations:
        <ul>
          <li>Yamaha</li>
          <li>Luna</li>
          <li>Epiphone</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
