    <h1>First Guitar Buying Guide</h1>

    <p>
      So you want to see about starting guitar lessons, but first you need a guitar. Here's a quick guide to help you out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some things to consider:
      <ul>
        <li>Do you want an <strong><em>electric</em></strong> or <strong><em>acoustic</em></strong> guitar?</li>
        <p>
          Either one can be suitable for beginners. Electric guitars require more equipment, but are louder in performances.
        </p>
        <li>Do you want a full-size, three-quarters or half-sized guitar?</li>
        <p>
          Normally anyone younger than 6 y/o will want a half-sized guitar. A guitar can't be too small, but it can be too big.
        </p>
      </ul>

      Here are some beginner electric guitar recommendations:
      <ul>
        <li>Squire</li>

        <li>Stagg</li>
      </ul>

        <ul>

          <li>Luna</li>
          <li>Epiphone</li>
        </ul>
